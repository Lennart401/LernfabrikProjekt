# LernfabrikML

This repository contains all machine learning code for the LernfabrikBoxen project. In general, the code takes in the samples recorded from the box, then preprocesses them, trains a model and exports the model as a tflite binary file. The only step left to do is converting the model to a c array (so it can be deployed on the Arduino).
