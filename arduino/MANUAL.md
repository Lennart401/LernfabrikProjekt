## 2. Technical instructions
This section contains technical instruction that anyone who wants to modify contents on the box without full code knowledge might need.

### 2.1 Compiling and uploading the code
Before you start:

1. If you are on linux or macOS, ensure that you have the Arduino CLI installed (`brew install arduino-cli`)
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed and did the code adjustments described in the README
3. Make sure you have the "Arduino Mbed OS Portenta Boards" installed (goto `Arduino IDE -> Tools -> "Board..." -> Boards Manager` and Search for "portenta")

#### Compiling and uploading on Windows

1. Open either the CoreM7 or CoreM4 project using the Arduino IDE.
2. Plug the board into the PC. Use a native USB Port, NOT a hub. Using a hub can cause unexpected/wrong behaviour.
3. Select the board and chip corresponding to the project you opened, e.g. the M7 core for the CoreM7-project and vice versa:<br/>
    `Arduino IDE -> Tools -> Board... -> Arduino Mbed OS Portenta Boards -> Arduino Portenta H7 (M7 Core)`
4. Select the correct port:<br/>
    `Arduino IDE -> Tools -> Port`, select COM5 or whatever the Arduino is at.
5. Click the upload button `(âž”)`

#### Compiling and uploading on linux/macOS (only tested on linux though)

For linux/macOS, there are some limitations with dfu-util and therefore the easiest way is to use the `arduino-util` script from the `scripts`-folder. It works as follows:

`arduino-util <core> <action> <port>`

- Core: either `m7` or `M4`, case-insensitive
- Action: either `compile` or `upload`, case-insensitive
- Port: the port of the Arduino, e. g. `/dev/ttyACM0`

To compile the code, run `arduino-util <core> compile`.<br/>
To upload (but not compile) the code, run `arduino-util <core> upload <port>`

Important! If you get an access error from dfu-util, try create new rule for the portenta:<br>
run `sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-arduino-portenta.rules` and then paste `SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341", ATTRS{idProduct}=="035b", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0666"` into the editor. Save the file using Ctrl-O and exit using Ctrl-X. The run `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules` to reload the device rules, uploading should now work. You may need to relog/reboot the PC in some cases.

:warning: If you having installed the Arduino CLI in its default location of `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/arduino-cli`, you will need to update the `arduino-util`-script.

### 2.2 Exchanging the model
Things to pay attention to:

1. Does the new model have the same classes as the old one? If not, you need to update the ProductionScreen on CoreM4
2. The variable name of the model changes.

#### Step by step
1. Export the new model as a c array using `xxd -i model_file.tflite > model.h`
2. Add the following lines to `model.h`

```c
// custom code
#define INPUT_TENSOR_SIZE <number of input tensors, e.g. 6>
#define OUTPUT_TENSOR_SIZE <number of output tensors, e.g. 8>
```

3. Replace the existing `model.h` file with the new `model.h` file
4. In `UnitDataProcessing.cpp`, change this line at the start of the `runDataProcessing` method to take the name of you new model, which is the variable name of the C array:

```c++
model = tflite::GetModel(NAME_OF_YOUR_MODEL);
```

5. If necessary, adjust the classes LUT on the ProductionPage of the UI.
